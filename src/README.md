# Note
This project was intended to be built with [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to learn more about it and using some of its features, so don't expect compatibility with other runtimes.

In this case, the most used features are: 

 - The Bun Shell `$`
 - JSX (it was fun to play with this but possibly getting rid of this in the future)
