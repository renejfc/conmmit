# Note

This directory is almost a 1:1 copy of the [@clack/prompts](https://github.com/natemoo-re/clack/blob/main/packages/prompts/) package. Initially I thought I would need them "raw" to be able to use them in a different context, but I don't think that's the case anymore. Most likely I'll just refactor this to use the `@clack/prompts` package directly and wrap them for my specific use case.
